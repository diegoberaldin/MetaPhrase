## Settings

The settings dialog allows to configure the application appearance and behaviour, in particular users can:
- change the application UI language (defaults to system language)
- configure the minimum similarity threshold for segments to be displayed in the Matches panel as fuzzy matches, items with a score lower than this threshold will be filtered out (defaults to 75%)
- see the application version for bug reporting purposes.
