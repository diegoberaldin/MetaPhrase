## Spellcheck

MetaPhrase contains a spelling checker function (that can be enabled or disabled in the settings dialog). If the current language is supported, whenever a message is opened for translation it is checked for spelling and, should errors be found, the corresponding words will be highlighted in red and underlined. By right-clicking on a spelling error, it will be possible to insert one of the suggestions from the context menu.

It is also possible to run a global spellcheck with the "Project" > "Check spelling" menu to inspect all the errors found in the validation panel. By clicking on each row the translation editor will scroll to the corresponding message to correct it.
