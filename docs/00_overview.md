# Overview

MetaPhrase is a powerful tool to provide translators and software localizers with a productive and distraction-free environment for their everyday tasks. The application is designed to look very similar to a classic text editor, where the text to be translated is divided into translation units, each of which consists of a source message (displayed as a reference) and a localized variant that users can insert and edit as part of their translation task.

MetaPhrase is targeted specifically for the internationalization of thr user interface of mobile applications and it has built-in support for the resource file formats used by native apps, i.e. XML on Android and stringtables on iOS. On top of it, support is being added for other common formats used in software localization, such as resx (popular in the .NET environment), PO (traditionally used by GNU gettext), JSON (in the format used by ngx-translate on Angular projects) and ARB (Flutter).

MetaPhrase makes it easier to maintain a single set of localizable items that can be exported to separate native formats, in order to ensure consistency among different platforms.
